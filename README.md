# Reporting a security issue

All security bugs in Orpiva should be reported to the core team through eMail
via [security@orpiva.com](mailto:security@orpiva.com).

Your report will be acknowledged within 24 hours and you will receive a more
detailed response to your eMail within 48 hours indicating the next steps in
handling your report.

Following the initial reply to your report the security team will endeavor to
keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full
announcement. These updates will be sent at least every five days, in reality
this is more likely to be every 24 to 48 hours.

If you have not received a reply to your initial eMail within 48 hours, or have not
heard from the security team for the past five days please contact the current security
coordinator.

## Disclosure Policy

Typically Orpiva has a five step disclosure policy, which we try to follow to the best of our ability.

1. Security report received and is assigned a primary handler. This person will
   coordinate the fix and release process.
2. Problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find
   any potential similar problems. We will contact you with further questions if necessary.
3. Fixes are prepared as quickly as possible and appled to our internal development and staging
   environments for testing and QA.
4. A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen and reconfirmed with you. This
   notification will include information about our applied patches to resolve this bug.
   Should this bug result from some FOSS software vulerability we use the message will include
   various reports to the respective maintainers and links.
5. On the embargo date, you are sent a copy of the final announcement.
   The changes will already be applied to the production system and the bug should be resolved.

Typically the embargo date will be set to 72 hours following the time of first
notification, however this may vary depending on the severity of the bug or
difficulty in applying a fix.

This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with maintainers of other
projects. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in a timely manner, however it is important
that we follow the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a consistent
manner.

I hope for your understanding and support with this.

As a reward and a token of our gratitude in disclosing this issue to us, we
